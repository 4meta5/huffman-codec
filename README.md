# Huffman Codes

Lossless data compression via [Huffman Codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)

## Rust

~300 loc with no dependencies, `no_std`

### Benchmarks

The implementation stores [Ascii](https://www.asciitable.com/) representations in [`Vec`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/vec/struct.Vec.html), and non-ascii codes in a [`BTreeMap`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/alloc/collections/btree_map/struct.BTreeMap.html). Benchmarks on `2.3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9` processor measure vector access as ~5x faster than `BTreeMap` for encode and decode.
